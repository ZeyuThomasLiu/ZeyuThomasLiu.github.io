- I am a first year PhD student at Yale University, [Yale Applied Cryptography Laboratory (YACL)](http://yacl.cs.yale.edu/), and luckily being advised by [Ben Fisch](https://sites.google.com/site/benafisch).

- Before coming to Yale, I obtained my Master's degree at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I was fortunate to be jointly advised by Prof. [Tal Malkin](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/) and Prof. [Eran Tromer](https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/). During my Master's study, I also worked part time as a researcher at [Duality Technologies Inc.](https://dualitytech.com/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by Dr. [Yuriy Polyakov](https://ypolyakov.gitlab.io/), and to work with Prof. [Daniele Micciancio](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~daniele/).

- My main research interests lie in the general area of cryptography, including lattice-based cryptography, blockchain-based cryptographic protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, and so on. Most of my recent research projects focus on Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes and their applications. Please see [here](https://zeyuthomasliu.github.io/publications/) for details.

# News

- Our paper [Large-precision homomorphic sign evaluation using FHEW/TFHE bootstrapping](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/133) got accepted to [ASIACRYPT 2022](https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2022/).

- Our paper [Oblivious Message Retrieval](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256) got accepted to [CRYPTO 2022](https://crypto.iacr.org/2022/).

- I just received the [Andrew P. Kosoresow Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching and Service](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/2017/top-students-in-computer-science-receive-awards/) at Columbia university.

<!-- - I am joining the [Yale Applied Cryptography Laboratory (YACL)](http://yacl.cs.yale.edu/) starting fall 2022 as a Ph.D. student! Already met the amazing co-directors of YACL, [Ben Fisch](https://sites.google.com/site/benafisch) and [Charalampos (Babis) Papamanthou](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/cpap/). Looking forward to meeting and working with other members! -->

<!-- - [Our paper about symmetric PIR](https://zeyuthomasliu.github.io/publications/paper3XSPIR) got accepted to [ESORICS 2022](https://esorics2022.compute.dtu.dk/). -->

<!-- - I recently received a [scholarship](https://grants.zfnd.org/proposals/470030928) from [Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG)](https://zcashomg.org/) to support the sixth year of my PhD program. -->

<!-- # Acknowledgement

- Sincerely and deeply thank every other school that sent me an offer for my Ph.D. applications. The application process is tough and stressful for a majority of applicants (surely including me). The emails containing interviews and offers were particularly reassuring. Special thanks to [Riad](https://wahby.net/), [Elaine](http://elaineshi.com/) and [Aayush](https://sites.google.com/view/aayushjain/home) at CMU for their patience and constant help during my application and deicison process. -->
