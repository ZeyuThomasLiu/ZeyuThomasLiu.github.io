- I am a PhD student at Yale University, [Yale Applied Cryptography Laboratory (YACL)](http://yacl.cs.yale.edu/), and luckily being advised by Prof. [Ben Fisch](https://sites.google.com/site/benafisch).

- Before coming to Yale, I obtained my Master's degree at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I was fortunate to be jointly advised by Prof. [Tal Malkin](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/) and Prof. [Eran Tromer](https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/). During my Master's study, I also worked part time as a researcher at [Duality Technologies Inc.](https://dualitytech.com/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by Dr. [Yuriy Polyakov](https://ypolyakov.gitlab.io/). Before that, I obtained by Bachelor's degree in CS and Math at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/).

- My main research interests lie in the general area of cryptography, including lattice-based cryptography, blockchain-based cryptographic protocols, and so on.
