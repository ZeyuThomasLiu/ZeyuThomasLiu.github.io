- I am an MSCS student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I am fortunate to be jointly advised by Prof. [Tal Malkin](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/) and Prof. [Eran Tromer](https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/).

- I also work part time as a research scientist trainee at [Duality Technologies Inc.](https://dualitytech.com/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Dr. [Yuriy Polyakov](https://ypolyakov.gitlab.io/), and to work with Prof. [Daniele Micciancio](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~daniele/).

- My main research interests lie in the general area of cryptography, including lattice-based cryptography, blockchain-based cryptographic protocols, information-theoretic cryptography, quantum cryptography, and differential privacy. Most of my recent research projects focus on Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes and their applications. Please see [here](https://zeyuthomasliu.github.io/publications/) for details.
