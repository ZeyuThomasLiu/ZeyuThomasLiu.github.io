- I am joining  the [Yale Applied Cryptography Laboratory (YACL)](http://yacl.cs.yale.edu/) starting fall 2022 as a Ph.D. student. Prior to that, I obtained my Master's degree from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I am fortunate to be jointly advised by Prof. [Tal Malkin](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/) and Prof. [Eran Tromer](https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/). 

- I also work part time as a researcher at [Duality Technologies Inc.](https://dualitytech.com/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Dr. [Yuriy Polyakov](https://ypolyakov.gitlab.io/), and to work with Prof. [Daniele Micciancio](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~daniele/).

- My main research interests lie in the general area of cryptography, including lattice-based cryptography, blockchain-based cryptographic protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, and so on. Most of my recent research projects focus on Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes and their applications. Please see [here](https://zeyuthomasliu.github.io/publications/) for details.

<!-- # Acknowledgement

- Sincerely and deeply thank every other school that sent me an offer for my Ph.D. applications. The application process is tough and stressful for a majority of applicants (surely including me). The emails containing interviews and offers were particularly reassuring. Special thanks to [Riad](https://wahby.net/), [Elaine](http://elaineshi.com/) and [Aayush](https://sites.google.com/view/aayushjain/home) at CMU for their patience and constant help during my application and deicison process. -->
