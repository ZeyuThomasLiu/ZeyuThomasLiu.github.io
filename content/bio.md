- Before coming to Yale, I obtained my Master’s degree at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), where I was fortunate to be jointly advised by Prof. [Tal Malkin](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/) and Prof. [Eran Tromer](https://cs-people.bu.edu/eran). 
- During my Master’s study, I also worked part time as a researcher at [Duality Technologies Inc.](https://dualitytech.com), where I was fortunate to be supervised by Dr. [Yuriy Polyakov](https://ypolyakov.gitlab.io).
